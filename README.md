# Mini Shop

## 1. Descriptions:

This project is a mini e-commerce web application that demonstrates the core features of an online shopping experience. Users can browse a collection of products, view detailed information about each item, and add products to their shopping cart. The cart supports dynamic quantity adjustments, allowing users to increase or decrease the number of items, with real-time updates to the total price. Once satisfied with their selections, users can proceed to a checkout page to review their order. This application serves as a foundational example of implementing interactive cart functionality and basic user flow in an e-commerce setting.
